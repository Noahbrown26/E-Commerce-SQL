## Description
This is the 13th challenge for my Coding bootcamp journey. For this challenge, we had to follow acceptance criteria to create a command-line application (using NodeJS, MySQL, and Express) that is capable of executing CRUD functions to interact with a database that was seeded. This application uses the ``MySQL2`` and ``Sequelize`` packages to connect to the MySQL database. ``Dotenv`` was used for environment variables to store sensitive data.
